Detailed Functionality
1. Matrix Operations
Implementation Details:

Dynamically creates 2D matrices of user-specified dimensions

Populates with pseudo-random integers (0-99 range)

Includes comprehensive input validation:

Positive integer checks

Buffer overflow protection

Type safety enforcement

Key Functions:

inputMatrixSize() - Validates dimension input

printMatrix() - Displays matrix in readable format

Matrix flattening for binary search preparation

2. Search Algorithms
Sequential Search
Scans matrix row-wise

Counts exact comparison operations

Returns first occurrence position

Time Complexity: O(m×n) for m×n matrix

Binary Search
Requires prior array sorting (O(n log n))

Implements classic divide-and-conquer approach

Counts comparison steps

Time Complexity: O(log n)

3. AVL Tree Implementation
Core Components:

Node structure with:

Integer key value

Left/right child pointers

Height tracking

Rotation operations:

Left rotation

Right rotation

Left-right double rotation

Right-left double rotation

Automatic rebalancing after insertions

Traversal Methods:

Pre-order (Root-Left-Right)

In-order (Left-Root-Right) - produces sorted output

Post-order (Left-Right-Root)
